# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is an in-depth analysis of crowdfunding data from Kickstarter using Microsoft Excel to visualize and interpret success and failure rates. --- 
### Purpose
Louise, a playwright, is beginning a crowdfunding campaign for her new play, Fever. The purpose of this project is to aid Louise in understanding what makes a successful Kickstarter campaign and to provide data-driven insights in order to mirror their success. ---

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

![Theater Outcomes vs Launch](kickstarter-analysis/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) --- ---
Data based on the category, outcomes, and the date each kickstarter in the theater category was created formed a pivot table which shows the success and failure rates of campaigns during individual months. This data may also be further filtered by year to show the success rate during a given year for the theater category.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

![Outcomes vs Goals](kickstarter-analysis/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) --- --- 
This chart demonstrates the outcomes based on the goal amount of the individual crowdfunding campaigns. For each range on the chart, the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns in the "plays" category on Kickstarter is counted. The lines on the graph represent the percentage of successful and failed Kickstarters in each range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The large number of sheets required to make analyses cause difficulty navigating and finding pertinent information. Additionally, some formulas with such a large data set caused Excel to perform slowly.

## Results

- The chart "Theater Outcomes vs Launch" shows that 53% of launches in the Theater category in the sample data were a success. Importantly, May had the largest number of successful launch dates, while January, June, July, and October had roughly the same number of failed fundraisers by date. 

--- ---

- The chart "Outcomes vs Goals" shows that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful campaigns. However, the mean and median pledges were also much lower than successful campaigns, meaning other factors are also at play that contribute to the failure of these campaigns.

--- ---

- It is important to note that this data offers insufficient feedback from backers to understand whether a campaign is compelling enough to pledge money toward it. ---

There is also no demographic data beyond "country."

--- ---

- Additional tables and graphs recommended for further insight include "Kickstarter Staff Picks vs Success Rate," "Date Created + Date Ended vs Success Rates," and "Successful Outcomes in Theater category by Year."
